# App made with poof.new

App is live at [scout.surf](https://scout.surf)

This is a React application built with Vite, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. It includes a modern development setup with ESLint, Prettier, and various UI components.

# Notes

The app is currenlty using USDC on mainnet due to limitations with the Corbits facilatior. We tried manually patching the SDK with CASH but that did not work. We are working on getting CASH working fully.
